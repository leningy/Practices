# Practices

- Loose coupling: an approach to interconnecting the components in a system or network so that those components, also called elements, depend on each other to the least extent practicable. 
- Multiplicity: how many objects participate in a relationship
- An object and its state is **serialized** when the information about the object, including the current values in the fields, are written to a file in a Java-specific format.
